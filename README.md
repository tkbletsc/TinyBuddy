TinyBuddy
=========

A host PCB for the ATtiny84 microcontroller.  Features two buttons, an activity LED, 16MHz crystal for accurate timekeeping, and USB or DC barrel jack for power.  The Rev2 design using entirely through-hole parts for easy construction.  Can be fabricated for about $7 through OSH Park.


Rev1: A micro-USB powered prototype.

- Ergonomic problem: instinct is to use it upside down
- Surface mount micro USB sucks to solder
- Programming ribbon cable presses up against reset button
- Pin silkscreens often cut off
- Labels of S7 and S8 reversed (duh!)

Rev2:

- Reoriented text and components to be used with chip facing away
- Switched to DC barrel connector for power
- Rearranged components to separate programming port, arranged things
better
- Design now uses entirely through-hole components
- Tweaked pin silk screens
- Fixed button labels
